<h1 class="myheader">What is Coaching?</h1>
<p class="mytext">

Coaching is ACTION Oriented and it is all about Moving Forward,
 Not dwelling on the past. So with a coach it really doesn’t
 matter how you got to where you are now, who is to blame 
 for how they turned out – Coaching is about where the person
 is right now and where he or she would like to be. 
 <br />
 
 Coaching is helping the individual or group build that bridge from 
 where they are right now and where they would like to be <br /> 
 Coaching is an ongoing partnership between the Coach and 
 the client designed to improve and enhance the person that
 is been coached quality of life. <br />
 
 Coaching works because of
 the partnership that is created. The coach helps the client
 develop new skills and awareness.<br />

 Coaching helps the client
 overcome limiting believes that holds the client back from
 achieving their goals to having them more fulfilling, 
 successful and effective lives. <br />
 
 Coaching can be defined
 as: "Supporting an individual or group of people through
 a TRANSITION in their lives", especially in a season like
 this where most people are right now is in the middle of
 a lot of transitions in their lives. Transition is their
 career, work, businesses, spiritual life, financial, health,
 relationships, families, community...etc

<button class="accordion">Why Coaching?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="mytext">
  In today’s world, Coaching isn't just for sports anymore.
  However, the roof of successful performances, achievements,
  and successes can be found in the coaching received by individuals
  enacting the great deeds<br />
  <br /> Coaches can help people take the next steps in their lives,
  for example help them successfully navigate through their 
  transitions. The transition could be moving up to the next 
  level of their health, relationship, work and financial lives.
  <br />
  <br /> It becomes a lot faster and easier to get to where you want
  to go to in your life if you have someone to walk the journey with
  you, navigating past the pitfalls and ditches, and pointing out 
  the shortcuts; someone who cares and is a professional supportive
  partner helping you in the process. This the difference coaching 
  makes.

<button class="accordion">What is the distinction about coaching?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="mytext">
 
 Finally, it is very important I draw the distinction between
 coaching that also set me apart from all the rest.<br /> Let us for
 a moment discuss the difference between being your Coach vs.
 Being a Therapist, vs. Being a Friend that gives good advice vs.
 being Supportive Spouse, vs. being a Consultant. 
  </p>
  <h1 class="smallheader">Being your Coach vs. Therapist/Psychiatrist:</h1>
   
  <ul class="mylist">
    <li><span style="color:  #66cc00"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>  Both relationships develop over time.</li>
  <li><span style="color:  #66cc00"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> Confidentiality is critical in both.</li>
 
  <li><span style="color:  #66cc00"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> The needs and wants of the clients are the focus for both.</li>
 
 <li><span style="color:  #66cc00"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> There are professional ethics and standards for both.</li>
  
</ul>
<h1 class="smallheader">What are the Distinctions between Being your Coach vs. Therapist/Psychiatrist?</h1>
<p class="mytext">
Coaching clients are individuals who take responsibility
 and they will benefit from accountability. Therapist and
 Psychiatrist work with clients who need professional help
 to work towards healing, recovery and issue resolution.<br /> 
 Coaches will work with clients who want a detached partner
 to help them evolve and enhance their lives.<br /> 
 Therapists are
 experts in medical and behavioral sciences, and they are 
 trained to treat diagnosable conditions like: Post Traumatic
 Stress Disorder, Addiction, Depression, Bipolar Disorder & 
 Other like conditions. While Coaches use personal disclosure
 as a tool to help and challenge their clients.
 
</p>

<h1 class="smallheader">Being your Coach vs. A Friend That Gives Good Advice:</h1>
<p class="mytext">
A coach holds the client accountable for what they want to
 create and achieve in their lives. Holding a friend accountable
 for what they want to create and achieve in their lives can 
 bring trouble.
 
</p>

<h1 class="smallheader">What Are The Distinctions Between Being your Coach vs. A Friend That Gives Good Advice?</h1>
<p class="mytext">
Coaching is NOT advice-giving, we don’t give advice whereas
 friends do. <br />
 Being your Coach vs. being a Supportive 
 Spouse: <br />It is difficult to stay objective because we are 
 emotionally involved to our spouses.
 
</p>

<h1 class="smallheader">Being your Coach vs. Being A Consultant:</h1>
<p class="mytext">
Our Coaches come from a wide variety of backgrounds including: Corporate, Education, Consulting, Communication, Law, Health Care and many others, and the truth are that there are as many types of coaches as there are people.
 
</p>
<h1 class="smallheader">What are the Distinctions between Being your Coach vs. Being A Consultant?</h1>
<p class="mytext">
As coaches we do not give advice, but rather guide the clients to their own solutions by asking powerful questions so that the clients allow their own inner wisdom to come to the right solutions for them. We are hired to support their clients as they achieve certain outcomes.
