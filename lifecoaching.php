Consider me to be your own, individual coach, helping you find solutions for life. I won’t judge you, I won’t tell you what you are doing is crazy or what you are thinking of doing won’t work. What I will do is support you in creating the life you want to live. I will help guide you where you seem to have gone off track. I will help you set priorities, identify your passions in life and get you to becoming the person you want to become. If you are not clear who that person is, we’ll work together on identifying the “new” you. We’ll identify those things that light you up and discover how you can put them to work in creating the best life you can live. Through conversations, exercises and a little guidance, you should be well on your way to a happier you!

<button class="accordion">What is Life Coaching?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="mytext">Life Coaching is a professional service providing clients with Feedback, Insights, and Guidance from an outside vantage point. 

The profession of coaching is similar to the practice of a physician, a trainer or psychologist, however, the major difference is that coaching is an On-going, Collaborative Partnership built on “Taking Action”

For example, say you want to accomplish a goal, maybe lose some few pounds or venture into a new career, or launch a new business, or get promoted at work or whatever it is you are looking to accomplish, you can either do it yourself or you can work with a supportive professional who will collaborate with you on the best ways to achieve your goals. 

A coach will invest the needful time, attention and focus just to make sure you are not just prepared emotionally, physically and mentally to do what you need to do, but above all will hold you accountable to make sure you stick to your chosen programs each week and month until you accomplish your goal. 

Something to also take to heart is that a coach who will help you decide what you really want for your life, getting clarity and purpose who will help you set goals tailored to your person, give you the required tools and support you all the way.

<button class="accordion">Managing Change</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="mytext">
  Are you feeling stuck and not sure what to do? Do you want to 
  make changes in your life but not sure where to begin? Are you 
  feeling overwhelmed? Often people resist change. The old adage, 
  we are creatures of habit is true. For some of us, we tend to 
  embrace change while others would prefer things to stay the same. 
  Regardless of the end of the spectrum you find yourself to be on, 
  when it comes to making changes for ourselves, we often get stuck. 
  That’s where I can help you. First, we begin by exploring together 
  where you are and where you want to be. Once we know which direction 
  we’re headed, we work together on developing next steps and breaking
  them into tiny pieces so that they are achievable yet not too large 
  that they feel unattainable. We continue the process until your changes have been implemented. 
  Soon you’ll look back and wonder why you were ever stuck!
