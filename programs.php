<button class="accordion">Goal Setting Signature Program™</button>
<div class="panel">
<p class="mytext">
As Patch Adams rightly said... You've got to know what you want.
 This is central to acting on your intentions. When you know what
 you want, you realize that all that is left then is time management.
 You'll manage your time to achieve your goals because you clearly
 know what you're trying to achieve in your life.

 Almost every individual and organization are already making
 resolutions or setting goals. But, sadly, most of them never
 realize those goals. It appears that setting goals are easy,
 but it’s just as easy to get discouraged, distracted,
 and derailed. Huge percentages of organizations lose
 motivation and lose momentum. It does not have to be that way.
 </p>
 
 <p class="mytext">
 As we move on in 2018 in these prevailing circumstances we want to help serious minded members open the door to a different set of possibilities. What could happen if our members in these present conditions could achieve their individual and church goals for 2018?
 </p>
 
 <p class="mytext">
 Goals should stretch us as individuals without overwhelming us. When most people are faced with seemingly impossible goals, they most times disengage, instead of being motivated by the goal, it saps their energy.
 </p>
 
 <p class="mytext">
 Mindset and perception are essential. Research on stretch goals shows that they can produce amazing results if people can imagine the possibility of accomplishing them.
 </p>
 
 <p class="mytext">
 I found one team exercise Kerr and LePelley discussed especially compelling. A team was able to make marginal performance improvements with a given task. But when they were told that another team was able to do it 85 percent faster, they got more creative and figured out how. By changing the perception of what was possible they triggered a new level of performance.
 </p>
 
 <p class="mytext">
 We earnestly believe that together we can help our members define their goals & dreams, craft a well-aligned plan, recognize what is holding your team back, be intentional about your church's vision so you can move forward with great momentum, clarity, and vision.
 </p>
 
 <p class="mytext">
 We delight ourselves on setting up our clients for success through understanding intentional Goal-Setting & Planning procedures for effective results and we are sure that your members will leave our sessions more prepared than they have ever been before to be intentional about their personal and church’s vision and goals and how their roles are of upmost 
 mportance. The workshop begins with a Pre-Assignment - Goal Setting & Planning Signature Program™

<div class="panel">

 A healthy self-esteem is essential for growth and achieving success. Of all the
judgments an individual make in life, none is as important as the one they make about themselves. Without some measure of self-worth, life can be painful and unrelenting. 
Participants of this course will discover some techniques that can dramatically change how they feel about themselves, and how they approach the world to get the things that they truly want.

<button class="accordion">Emotional Insight Signature Program™</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="mytext">
Emotional insight, also called EQ or emotional intelligence,
 is the ability to be aware of and to manage emotions and 
 relationships. It’s a pivotal factor in personal and 
 professional success. IQ will get you in the door, 
 but it is your EQ, your ability to connect with others
 and manage the emotions of yourself and others, that 
 will determine how successful you are in life.  <br />
 <br />
 We have all worked with and listened to brilliant people.
 Some of them were great and… well, some were not so great.
 The mean and the meek and all those in between can teach us
 more than they realize. <br />
 When we look at the truly 
 extraordinary people who inspire and make a difference
 you will see that they do this by connecting with people
 at a personal and emotional level. What differentiated 
 them was not their IQ but their EQ – their emotional
 intelligence. This one-day course will give you the EQ edge.

<button class="accordion">Becoming a Competent Reaper Signature Program™</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="mytext">
 
Becoming a Competent Reaper is a practical seminar for understanding how to REAP and become good Reapers. 
 
Many believers are of the mindset that reaping is automatic,
 just sow and you will reap, however, now farmer just sows 
 and then goes out to reap because there are certain 
 preparations that he or she must put in place to guarantee
 a harvest. 
 <br />
 Have you ever wondered where is the 30/60/100
 fold harvest you were promised in the word???
 <br />
 <br />
 WELL, you are not alone. A lot of Christians are very 
 good givers but lousy reapers. The misconception of
 the law of sowing and reaping has led to 
 misunderstanding among Christians of the respective
 roles and relations displayed in sowing and reaping
 . Folks are not reaping off what they sow and not
 harvesting the way they ought to.
