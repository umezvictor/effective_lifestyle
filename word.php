Think twice before you speak, because your 
words and influence will plant the seed of either 
success or failure in the mind of another.  <i style="color: red">Napoleon Hill</i> 
</p>

<p class="mytext">
About two years or so ago sometime in September was my father's 
birthday and for some reason, I could not get to speak 
with him on his birthday due to bad network and the weather 
was just terrible.  I usually don’t miss birthdays and 
anniversaries and I never knew that others had taken 
notice of it about me. 

</p>

<p class="mytext">
I became known to not just my family members but also close friends as the guy who never forgets ‘birthdays’ and ‘special anniversary’, but I forgot to call my dads' to wish him a happy birthday on his birthday?
</p>

<p class="mytext">
My younger sister called to check up on me, her conclusion was that something was wrong with me. She said to me ‘when we did not hear from you on Dad’s birthday we thought that it strange and something bad may have happened to you. That was my wake up call to how much your words and presence means to others.  
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Have you noticed how we get used to doing some things in a certain way that we really never stop to think how much they affect others?
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Why would she think like that was my reasonable question and her answer simply confirmed something I knew inside of me "The ability to be there for others, bringing words that would comfort, inspire, motivate and challenge. Something to cheer others on letting them know I believed in them and would support them the best way I came was a call of God I just couldn’t shake off, and trust me I had tried doing that on many occasions. I see now that I have been wired specially and empowered to deliver at that level.
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Now don’t take this in a spooky way but I began noticing that I would seemingly share thoughts with others and later discover from them that those words were the exact words they needed for that specific hour and how much it blessed them. I began to value what words came out of my mouth, I became choosy and selective with my words.
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Inspiring, motivating, believing in, helping, standing with others is something I do seemingly effortlessly now, but I still work on getting better daily - that is what quotes have done for me personally.
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Something Steve Maraboli said in his book, Unapologetically You: Reflections on Life and the Human Experience that readily comes to mind: “Today is a new day. It's a day you have never seen before and will never see again. Stop telling yourself the 'same crap, different day' lie! How many days has that lie stolen from you? Seize the wonder and uniqueness of today! Recognize that throughout this beautiful day, you have an incredible amount of opportunities to move your life into the direction you want it to go.” 
... , you have an incredible amount of opportunities to move your life into the direction you want it to go with words. Do you know that words are thoughts clothed in vocabulary? Thoughts are expressed in words, but words also create thoughts which are linked to your belief system and let me show you why that is so important to your life and destiny.

<p class="mytext">
Over the years I have come to discover the beauty, inspirational and motivational power of quotes. They have become the most popular way most people start their day - whenever you want something to motivate, inspire or even challenge you at the start of your day.
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Quotes will enable you to look at things from a different perspective, and how much that will affect the outcome by just simply changes the way you looked at the situation – that is what a good quote can do for you.
</p>

<p class="mytext">
Back then I would send out these quotes to my contacts on my phone and occasionally email my friends however I recently decided to start a blog and have people subscribe to the quotes which I now call WORDs in SEASON.
</p>

<p class="mytext">
My question to you is this, “What words have you been speaking to yourself or hearing?” They will shape your tomorrow for either good or bad, but the choice is "Yours" and no one else. That is how powerful words are...
  
"For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." ~ Jesus Christ
