In most of our trainings, public speaking and seminars we are often 
asked what our suggestions would be in getting started; one major 
area we have always suggested is firstly "getting a coach" especially 
if this is something you've struggled with for a while or something you have tried doing with little or no success or even something you have always wanted to do but never had the courage to go for it.
